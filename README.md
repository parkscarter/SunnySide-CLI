# SunnySide-CLI
This CLI was written as my first real practice with Go. It makes calls to an external API to gather information about the current weather based on location. 
As currently implemented, the program simply returns the current temperature at a location given by zip code (United States Only) 
Future plans include searching location by name, providing more weather information, and improving the user interface
